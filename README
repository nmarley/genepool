GenePool - Perl Dancer app for tracking Genealogy


=== NOTE/WARNING ===

This is very immature software. It's my real first attempt at a Dancer
application.


=== INSTALL ===

# First create the SQLite3 DB:
sqlite3 genes.db < genepool.sqlite3

# Then populate with some data
# (feel free to add your own data to make it more relevant to you):
./populate_db.pl 

# Then start dancer
./bin/app.pl


=== TODO ===

The only route currently written is "GET /get/:id", which fetches a Person object.
This will probably be changed to "GET /person/:id", then other routes to
add/modify Persons will be added.
